# CorpTech AI Landing Page

This repository contains the CorpTech AI consultancy landing page with sections for hero, about, services, projects, process, and contact. The experience features neon gradients, holographic cards, scroll-triggered reveals, and a slowed matrix-style background animation.

## Running locally
Open `index.html` directly in your browser or serve the folder with any static file server, for example:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit http://localhost:8000/.

## Deploying to main
The latest code lives on this branch. To replace the `main` branch with it, merge or fast-forward `main` to this commit:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge work
# or: git checkout main && git reset --hard <this_commit>
```

Push the updated `main` branch to your remote to publish the site.
